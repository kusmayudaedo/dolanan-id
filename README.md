### Description

Welcome to my learning journey in front-end web development! I'm thrilled to introduce you to dolanan.id—a dynamic gaming discovery webpage crafted with TypeScript and React. This project is a testament to my commitment to mastering the intricacies of these powerful technologies.

Powered by rawg.io API:

Behind the scenes, this webpage harnesses the power of the rawg.io API. This integration allows me to Learn the art of fetching and integrating data from external APIs, in this case, the comprehensive rawg.io API.

Some key points implement in this project :

- Fetching data from external API using Axios
- Styling component and layout using Chackra UI
- Implementing dark and light theme
- Build responsive page for mobile device and larger devices
- Fetch and update data using React Query
- Implement routing using React Router
